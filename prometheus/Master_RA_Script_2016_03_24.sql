########SQL Script to Create the Input Files for RA/SA#################

######The script includes the following Steps

#1. Creating shells for the final tables and several intermediate tables

#2. Populating the 'ra_episode_data" table

#3. Populating the "ra_riskfactors' table

#4. Populating the 'ra_subtypes' table

#5. Populating the 'ra_cost_use' table

#6. Remove filtered episodes
